        <p class="had2">
            Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve <br> my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start designing <br> some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and stored on my cell <br> phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more <br> sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) <br> made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that <br> the result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.
